        <li><b>Albumin:</b> Maintains blood volume and pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Globulins:</b> Involved in immune response.</li>
        <li><b>Fibrinogen:</b> Essential for blood clotting.</li>
        <li><b>Red Blood Cells (RBC's):</b> Also known as erythrocytes, these cells are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs.</li>
        <li><b>White Blood Cells (WBC's):</b> Also known as leukocytes, these cells are essential for the immune system, protecting the body against infections and foreign substances. These are several types of WBC's, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils.</li>
        <li><b>Platelets:</b> Small cell fragments involved in blood clotting. They help prevent excessive bleeding by forming clots at injury sites.</li>
